Pawsitivity - a fun, easy solution to bring the right pet into your home. As a user, you are able to create a profile that outlines the type of environment you reside in and select your preference for the type of animal you would like to add to your family. Once this profile has been created, the user will be able to "swipe" through a list of real, adoptable pets within 100 miles of the location entered upon creating your profile. The pets that presented will already be filtered based upon the environmental variables entered while signing up - if a user has dogs, cats or children at home and the pet in question requires a home without one of these factors, the pet will not show up as an option while the user is swiping. This ensures that the user has a positive experience and is not presented with animals that would not be well suited in their living situation, and most importantly, ensures that the animal in quesiton is placed in the correct home that will meet their basic requirements for a happy life. A user is able to contact and view the location of an organization that a specific pet is held at, as well as all available details pertaining to that pet. Should a user's animal preference or environment change at any point, they may simply update their profile.

Should an organization be interested in uploading their adoptable pets to Pawsitvity rather than to PetFinder, a user also has an option to create an account with the organization information. From this page, they are able to add and remove their adoptable animals and update their organization's information. Organization-side functionality for including these pets within the user-facing swipe pages is still in progress, as it was not an initial goal.
